## Project Overview:
As part of the Bright Network Technology Academy, we were assigned a group project where the team had completely free reign– The aim was  to design and build a full-stack application to provide a service or solve a problem within a two week period. As a group we decided to create an application to provide a service.

<br>

Pixelated Paradise is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy gaming goods over the Internet using a web browser or a mobile app. The application allows shoppers to use "search" and "filter" features to find specific models, brands or items. Once a particular product has been found, the shopping cart feature allows consumers to accumulate multiple items and adjust quantities, just like filling a physical shopping cart or basket in a conventional store... Not keen on checking out? At Pixelated Paradise you can even sign up and sign in to save items for later purchase!

 ### This API features:
 
    - One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many and Many-to-One relationships
    - Derived queries for multiple endpoints
    - Full CRUD functionality

## Setup and Instructions for using the Project:

1. Make sure that you have Java 17/18 installed to run Pixelated Paradise API
2. Clone this repository by typing the following command into your terminal: <br>
git clone git@github.com:JinleYe/online_store.git
3. You can access the endpoints via an API platform such as Postman or through the browser at https://localhost:8080/{endpoint}
4. You can also view the SQL tables by connecting to the h2 datatbase at localhost:8080/h2 and entering the following URL in the 'JDBC URL' section - jdbc:h2:file:./db/online_store. Note: spring.datasource.username=sa

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP):
For our MVP, we wanted to create an API with full CRUD functionality with 7x classes:
- X
- Y
- Z


## Extensions:
For our extension, we wanted to expand on the MVP and challenge ourselves with the following extensions:
- X
- Y 
- Z

## Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs):

## Running the API - List of Possible Commands (CRUD Functionality):

The following table shows a list of possible commands used alongside: localhost:8080/ ...

## Testing:
The project involved different forms of testing including unit testing and testing via Postman. 

Unit testing: This process allowed for the testing of the smallest code in the system that could be logically isolated i.e., the methods and derived queries. 

Example of unit testing: 

<br>
Unit testing:

![Unit testing]()

<br>

Postman testing: This application was the HTTP client that tested HTTP requests, using a graphical user interface, through which we obtained different types of responses that needed to be subsequently validated.  

Example of Postman testing: 

<br>
Postman:

![Postman Testing]()

<br>

This process allowed us to evaluate and verify that our Pixelated Paradise API did what it was supposed to do; it prevented bugs and improved performance.


## Further Implementations:
Here are a few ideas on how we would like to expand on this API:
- X
- Y
- Z
